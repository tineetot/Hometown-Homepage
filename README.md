# Hometown-Homepage
A responsive, aesthetic landing page dedicated to my hometown, built as part of my journey to master HTML5 and CSS3 via Scrimba.

### 📖 Project Overview
This project was a deep dive into the foundations of web development. I focused on creating an inviting, structured page for Mandaluyong—the geographic heart of Metro Manila. It highlights the city's balance of massive retail hubs and local "hole-in-the-wall" charm.

### ✨ What I Mastered:
* **Semantic HTML:** Organising content with meaningful tags for better accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS Box Model:** Using `margin: auto`, `padding`, and `border-radius` to create clean, elevated containers for my headings.
* **Typography:** Integrating Google Fonts (*Noto Sans Display*) to give the site a modern, clean look.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Implementing background images with `background-size: cover` and layering text using shadows and semi-transparent colors.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Styling, Layout, & Effects)
* **Google Fonts** (Noto Sans)
* **Vercel** (Hosting & Deployment)
